# Chat History with ChatGPT

This is the chat history with ChatGPT in which we asked on about how to run the huggingface llm locally by providing certain prompts. It teaches us how you can define all your required libraries in requirements.txt file and how can you run one single script to do prompts.

You said:
I have a big .ipynb notebook with lots of prompts in it running this model that you just saw above. I am currently using Google Colab but is there a way I can run it locally so it uses my macbook resources?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — you absolutely can run your .ipynb notebook locally on your MacBook using llama-cpp-python, as long as your Mac has a decent CPU (or ideally Apple Silicon). Here's how:

## Summary
You can replicate your entire Colab notebook on MacBook by:
- Installing dependencies locally
- Downloading the GGUF model
- Adjusting the path in Llama(...)
- Running the notebook using Jupyter


Would you like a full requirements.txt to make this smoother? Or a sample launcher script (run_local_llm.py) that mimics your notebook?
You said:
yes please give me the script
ChatGPT said:
Great! Here's a complete starter script that mirrors your Google Colab notebook but runs locally on your MacBook (CPU or Apple Silicon). This script does the following:
Installs the required Python packages (if needed)


Downloads the GGUF model from Hugging Face


Loads the model using llama-cpp-python


Defines a prompt-response function


Runs a sample prompt



✅ run_local_llm.py

🚀 Run Your Local Script
python run_local_llm.py


You said:
what if I have multiple queries, can I add them in the script so they are executed one after another? For example: 1. query="What is the protocol for managing sepsis in a critical care unit?" 2. query="What are the common symptoms for appendicitis, and can it be cured via medicine? If not, what surgical procedure should be followed to treat it?" 3. query="What are the effective treatments or solutions for addressing sudden patchy hair loss, commonly seen as localized bald spots on the scalp, and what could be the possible causes behind it?"
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — you can run multiple queries in sequence by looping through a list of them.
Here’s how you can modify your run_local_llm.py script to handle multiple medical queries, one after another.

✅ Updated run_local_llm.py (with multiple queries)
# run_local_llm.py

import os
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
from llama_cpp import Llama

# -----------------------------
# 1. Download GGUF model from Hugging Face
# -----------------------------
MODEL_REPO = "TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF"
MODEL_FILENAME = "mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q6_K.gguf"

print("Downloading model from Hugging Face...")
model_path = hf_hub_download(
    repo_id=MODEL_REPO,
    filename=MODEL_FILENAME,
    local_dir="models",
    local_dir_use_symlinks=False
)
print(f"Model downloaded to: {model_path}")

# -----------------------------
# 2. Load the model with llama-cpp
# -----------------------------
print("Loading model into Llama...")
llm = Llama(
    model_path=model_path,
    n_ctx=2300,
    n_batch=512,
    n_gpu_layers=0  # Set to 0 for CPU; Metal GPU is auto-used on Mac
)

# -----------------------------
# 3. Define response function
# -----------------------------
def generate_response(query, max_tokens=512, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.95, top_k=50):
    output = llm(
        prompt=f"Q: {query}\nA:",
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        temperature=temperature,
        top_p=top_p,
        top_k=top_k
    )
    return output["choices"][0]["text"].strip()

# -----------------------------
# 4. Define multiple queries
# -----------------------------
queries = [
    "What is the protocol for managing sepsis in a critical care unit?",
    "What are the common symptoms for appendicitis, and can it be cured via medicine? If not, what surgical procedure should be followed to treat it?",
    "What are the effective treatments or solutions for addressing sudden patchy hair loss, commonly seen as localized bald spots on the scalp, and what could be the possible causes behind it?"
]

# -----------------------------
# 5. Run all queries and display results
# -----------------------------
if __name__ == "__main__":
    for i, query in enumerate(queries, 1):
        print(f"\n--- Query {i} ---")
        print(f"Q: {query}")
        answer = generate_response(query)
        print(f"A: {answer}")


🧪 Output Example
When you run:
python run_local_llm.py

You'll get:
--- Query 1 ---
Q: What is the protocol for managing sepsis in a critical care unit?
A: [generated answer]

--- Query 2 ---
Q: What are the common symptoms for appendicitis...
A: [generated answer]

...and so on


✅ Bonus Tips
Want to save responses to a file? Add this at the end of the loop:


with open("responses.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write(f"\n\n--- Query {i} ---\nQ: {query}\nA: {answer}\n")


Want JSON output? Store each result in a dict and json.dump() them at the end.


Let me know if you'd like that version too.
You said:
okay i am going to try this. I have started a new terminal on my macbook and ran brew install python which ran fine
ChatGPT said:
Perfect! 🎉 You're off to a great start.
Here’s what to do next step-by-step from your terminal:

✅ Step-by-Step from Here
1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
This keeps dependencies clean:
python3 -m venv llama-env
source llama-env/bin/activate


2. Create your project file
You can create a Python script using a terminal text editor (like nano) or VS Code:
nano run_local_llm.py

Then paste in the updated multi-query script I gave you above.
To save in nano:
Press Ctrl + O (write)


Press Enter (confirm)


Press Ctrl + X (exit)



3. Create a requirements.txt
Also run:
nano requirements.txt

Paste this:
llama-cpp-python==0.1.85
huggingface_hub
sentence-transformers
langchain
langchain-community
chromadb
PyMuPDF
tiktoken
pandas

Save the same way as above.

4. Install your dependencies
Make sure you're still in your llama-env (check prompt) and run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

This might take a minute or two.

5. Run the script
Once everything is installed, simply do:
python run_local_llm.py

You'll see each query and its answer printed out.

❓ Want to check model download location?
You can ls the models directory (it’s created by hf_hub_download) to confirm:
ls models

Jupyter notebook version


I'm here to help as you go.
You said:
but previously you said to run pip install notebook, should I run it?
ChatGPT said:
Great catch — here's the rule of thumb:

✅ When to Run pip install notebook
You should only install notebook if:
🔹 You plan to:
Use Jupyter Notebooks locally (i.e., open .ipynb files in a browser).


Run interactive experiments (like you do in Google Colab).


Then yes, go ahead and run:
pip install notebook

After that, start the Jupyter Notebook interface like this:
jupyter notebook

Your browser will open with the Jupyter UI where you can open .ipynb files, create cells, and run them.

🚫 Don't install if:
You plan to run only .py scripts in the terminal (like run_local_llm.py).

✅ Summary:
Goal
Install notebook?
Run .ipynb in browser (Jupyter)
✅ Yes
Run .py script from terminal only
❌ Not needed

Let me know which direction you're going — I can give you the proper structure either way.
You said:
okay my script is running and it is on the first query right now for more than 15 mins
ChatGPT said:
Good progress so far — now let’s troubleshoot the slow first query:

⚠️ Likely Reasons It’s Taking >15 mins:
1. Model is still loading into memory
Mistral-7B Q6_K is a large model (~4.9 GB).


llama_cpp.Llama(...) may take a few minutes on first call, especially:


On MacBooks with limited RAM


If using CPU-only mode


If it's still compiling some Metal (GPU) layers on Apple Silicon


✅ How to tell:
 If it’s stuck at the first llm(...) call, this is normal on first launch. Future queries will be much faster.

2. Too many n_ctx tokens
You’re using n_ctx=2300 — that’s big.


Try reducing to n_ctx=1024 or even 768 for a faster first response.


llm = Llama(
    model_path=model_path,
    n_ctx=1024,
    n_batch=256,
    n_gpu_layers=0  # or leave out for Metal
)


3. Not using Metal GPU on Apple Silicon
If you're on M1/M2/M3, the Metal backend should be used automatically. But to be safe, check this environment variable is not set:
echo $LLAMA_CPP_FORCE_CPU

If it prints anything, unset it:
unset LLAMA_CPP_FORCE_CPU


✅ What You Can Do Now
Wait up to ~20 minutes max for first run (especially if you haven’t restarted since install).


Reduce n_ctx to 1024 in the script and try again.


Run again — subsequent runs are much faster (cache kicks in).



🧪 Want to verify Metal is used?
You can update your script to print the backend used:
print(f"Loaded model with backend: {llm.context.backend}")


Let me know:
Your Mac model (M1? Intel?)


If you're okay uploading your current script and I’ll check for bottlenecks


If the second query starts faster — that’s a good sign!


You said:
can I cancel the script in the middle as it is on the first query at the moment? and if I rerun with the changes, will it reload everything and take same time?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, you can safely cancel the script while it’s stuck on the first query — no harm done.

❌ How to Cancel the Script
In the terminal:
Press Ctrl + C
 (This sends a KeyboardInterrupt and stops the current process.)


You’ll see something like:
^C
KeyboardInterrupt

That’s expected.

🔁 What Happens When You Rerun?
Case A: Script is unchanged
Yes — it will re-load the model from scratch.


First query may take a long time again.


Case B: ✅ You made these optimizations:
Reduce n_ctx to something like 1024 or 768


Lower n_batch to 256 or 128


Skip big loops and run just one short test prompt like:


query = "What is the capital of France?"


✅ Then you’ll notice:
Model loads faster


First query returns quickly


Later prompts run much faster (few seconds)



🧠 Pro Tip: Test LLM with Just One Line
Before looping over medical queries, test it with this simple script:
response = llm("Q: What is the capital of France?\nA:", max_tokens=32)
print(response["choices"][0]["text"])

If this works in <1 minute, you’re good to scale up.

Let me know if you'd like me to modify your script to only:
Load the model


Run a quick test prompt


Then exit cleanly


That way you can confirm everything is working before going big again.
You said:
what should I add to the script so that it prints the time it starts running my query and end time when it comes back with the response?
ChatGPT said:
Great idea — tracking start and end times helps you profile performance.
You can use Python’s built-in time or datetime module. Here's how:

✅ Modify Your Script to Track Timing
In your generate_response() function (or inside the loop), use this:
import time
from datetime import datetime

def generate_response(query, max_tokens=512, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.95, top_k=50):
    print(f"\n[Start] {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")
    start_time = time.time()

    output = llm(
        prompt=f"Q: {query}\nA:",
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        temperature=temperature,
        top_p=top_p,
        top_k=top_k
    )

    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"[End]   {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")
    print(f"[Duration] {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")

    return output["choices"][0]["text"].strip()


🖨️ Example Output
--- Query 1 ---
Q: What is the capital of France?

[Start] 2025-07-16 17:32:10
[End]   2025-07-16 17:32:13
[Duration] 3.42 seconds
A: Paris


Let me know if you'd like to:
Log this to a file instead


Format into a nice table


Track GPU usage or RAM as well


You said:
how can I see what process is taking time and if it is really working behind the scene?
ChatGPT said:
Great question — when a model call takes a long time, it’s helpful to know if it's actually working or just stuck.
Here are several ways to monitor what's going on behind the scenes on your Mac:

✅ 1. Use top or htop in Terminal
Option A: top (pre-installed)
Open a new terminal window, run:
top -o cpu

Look for a process using:
High CPU% (usually python3)


Or command like llama-cpp-python


If your script is running and model is generating:
You should see python3 using ~90–100% CPU


Or, on Apple Silicon, you'll see Metal-related CPU/GPU activity


Press q to quit.

You said:
yeah I see these two on top when I do top -o cpu PID COMMAND %CPU TIME #TH #WQ #PORT MEM PURG CMPRS PGRP PPID STATE BOOSTS %CPU_ME %CPU_OTHRS UID FAULTS COW 0 kernel_task 73.7 04:35:10 565/8 0 0 47M+ 0B 0B 0 0 running 0[0] 0.00000 0.00000 0 57032+ 0 47964 Python 41.2 05:01.83 5/1 1 39 112M 0B 91M+ 47964 20768 running *0[1] 0.00000 0.00000 504 26543161+ 478
ChatGPT said:
That’s a very good sign — it confirms that:
✅ Your script is actively working
The process Python (PID 47964) is using ~41% CPU — this means it's generating a response or processing a model call.


kernel_task is high too (~73%) — that’s typical on macOS when the system is managing a lot of background or memory-intensive work (like Metal GPU tasks or memory throttling).


MEM = ~112MB for Python → looks low, so likely it hasn’t loaded the entire model yet, or you’re still in warmup/compilation phase.


⏱️ If It’s Been >15–20 Minutes
Try these:
✅ 1. Reduce context size
In your script:
llm = Llama(
    model_path=model_path,
    n_ctx=1024,
    n_batch=256,
    n_gpu_layers=0
)

This speeds up generation dramatically.

✅ 2. Run a very short prompt to confirm it's alive
Replace your current query with:
query = "What is the capital of France?"

And comment out the rest.
If this returns quickly, then the model is working fine — your original medical queries may just be very long and token-heavy.

✅ 3. Add logging to see where it's stuck
Add these prints:
print("Prompt is ready, calling model...")
output = llm(prompt=query, max_tokens=512)
print("Model responded!")


You said:
so at this point, is it running everything locally now? what if I go without internet connection?
ChatGPT said:
✅ Yes — at this point, it is running entirely locally.
Once the model is downloaded and loaded like you're doing with:
model_path = hf_hub_download(
    repo_id=MODEL_REPO,
    filename=MODEL_FILENAME,
    local_dir="models",
    local_dir_use_symlinks=False
)

Hugging Face's hf_hub_download() saves the model to disk in models/, and:
llm = Llama(model_path=model_path, ...)

uses that local .gguf file, not the internet.

🌐 Can You Run Without Internet?
✅ Yes — after first download, you are offline-ready:
No remote model calls


No cloud inference


No Hugging Face APIs


No LangChain agents hitting the web



🔌 To Fully Test Offline Mode:
After the first run succeeds:
Disconnect your Mac from Wi-Fi


Re-run the script (same queries)


✅ It should work perfectly


If you get any error, it's likely only in the initial model download step, which you’ve already done.

📁 Optional Tip: Use local_dir explicitly
To lock everything into a folder you control:
model_path = hf_hub_download(
    repo_id=MODEL_REPO,
    filename=MODEL_FILENAME,
    local_dir="models",  # You can zip or share this later
    local_dir_use_symlinks=False
)

Then you’re 100% portable and reproducible on any Mac that has Python and llama-cpp-python.

You said:
so what kind of model is this and what kind of questions it can answer? # ----------------------------- # 1. Download GGUF model from Hugging Face # ----------------------------- MODEL_REPO = "TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF" MODEL_FILENAME = "mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q6_K.gguf"
ChatGPT said:
Great question — you're using a very capable local LLM. Here's a breakdown:

🧠 What Model You're Using
✅ Model: TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF
Base Model: Mistral-7B
 → Created by Mistral AI, it's an open-source, high-performing LLM comparable to LLaMA 2 13B — but more efficient.


"Instruct" variant: Fine-tuned to follow instructions, much like ChatGPT.
 → It’s trained to handle direct questions, prompts, and tasks in a helpful and conversational way.


GGUF Format: Quantized format (e.g., Q6_K) that makes the model:


Smaller (4–5 GB)


Memory-efficient


Runnable on CPU or Apple Silicon (Metal)


Compatible with llama-cpp-python



🤔 What Can This Model Do?
✅ It Can Answer:
🔍 General knowledge Q&A


📄 Summarization


🧠 Explanations and reasoning


🩺 Medical/academic questions (like the ones you asked)


🧾 Code-related queries (to some extent)


💬 Natural language understanding and conversation


🔶 Examples:
Prompt Type
Example
Factual Q&A
“What is the capital of Brazil?”
Medical
“What is the treatment for appendicitis?”
Instructional
“Explain how a bill becomes law in the US.”
Opinion-based (limited nuance)
“Should we use renewable energy?”
Language tasks
“Summarize this paragraph” or “Translate to French”
Code logic or description
“What does this Python function do?”


🚫 Limitations (Important)
❌ It does not access the internet — all answers come from its training data (cutoff ~2023).


❌ Not as nuanced or up-to-date as GPT-4 or Claude 3.


❌ May hallucinate or be overconfident — especially for complex legal, medical, or numerical tasks.



✅ Best Use Cases (Offline & Fast)
Running your own private assistant


Question answering over documents (PDFs → RAG)


Summarization of files


Local chatbot with no cloud/API usage


Safe prototyping for enterprise/regulated environments



Let me know if you want:
A prompt guide for best performance (e.g., system prompts or [INST] format)
